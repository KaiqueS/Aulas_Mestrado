    "<i>Edges</i> in a graph can be <i>directed</i> and <i>undirected<i/>. For any pair of nodes a and b, we say that an edge is <i>directed</i> when there is an edge from a to b, but not an edge from b to a. In this case, we call a the </i>parent</i> node and b the <i>child</i> node.\n",

    "A path is <i>directed</i> if not one node in it has two edges into it or out of it. When two nodes are connected by a directed path, the first node is called <i>ancestor</i> and the second node is called <i>descendant</i>.\n",

    "If there is a directed path to a node back to itself, then the path is called <i>cyclic</i>. Else, it is called <i>acyclic</i>\n",

    "A structural causal modelis a triple ( U, V, f ) of sets, where U and V are sets of variables, and f is a set of functions from V to a set of values. U is the set of <i>exogenous variables</i>, the variables external to the model. V is the set of <i>endogenous variables</i>. Any v in V is a descendant of at least one u in U, whereas no u in U is a descendant of other variables, be them endogenous or exogenous. Exogenous variables are also called <i>root</i> nodes in graphs.\n",

    "X is said to be a <i>direct cause</i> of Y if X appears in the function that assigns Y's value. NOTE: this explanation is as bullshitty as the definition of the functions in a SCM.\n",

    "X is said to be a <i>cause</i> of Y if X is a direct cause or of any cause of Y. I.e., is X is a direct cause of Y or a direct cause of Z, which is a direct cause of Y. E.g., X -> Z -> Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <i>graphical causal model</i>, which are graphical representations of SCM's, consists in a set of nodes, each representing a variable either in U or V of the SCM, and a set of functions f, which are represented by edges in the graph. Edges are constructed in the following way: if, in a SCM M, a variable X associated with a function f<sub>X</sub> contains within it a variable Y, i.e., if X depends on Y, then, there will be in G an edge from Y to X. Even if a graphical model specifies a SCM, it is not possible to fully specify a SCM solely from a graph, because it is not possible to access the definition of the function behind an edge. \n",
